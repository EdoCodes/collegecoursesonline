## Income Share Agreements (ISAs)

### What Is an ISA?

**Income Share Agreement** = Pay nothing upfront, pay % of income after you get a job

**How It Works:**
1. You attend a bootcamp or course (pay $0 upfront)
2. After graduation, if you get a job making > threshold (e.g., $40,000)
3. You pay X% of income (typically 10-17%) for Y months (typically 24-48 months)
4. Payment caps at maximum amount (typically 1.5-2x program cost)

**Example:**
- Bootcamp costs $15,000
- ISA terms: 15% of income for 36 months if you earn $40,000+
- You get job at $70,000
- Monthly payment: $70,000 × 15% ÷ 12 = $875/month
- Total paid: $875 × 36 = $31,500
- If job pays $50,000: $625/month, $22,500 total
- If no job or below threshold: Pay $0

### Programs Offering ISAs

**Coding Bootcamps:**

**Lambda School (now Bloom Institute of Technology)**
- $0 upfront
- 17% of income for 24 months
- Only pay if earning $50,000+

**Cons:**

- ❌ Complex terms and conditions

**Is an ISA Right for You?**

**Good fit if:**
