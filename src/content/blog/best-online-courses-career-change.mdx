### ❌ Mistake 4: Not Building Portfolio
**Problem:** Only watching courses, no projects  
**Solution:** Build something every week, even small

### ❌ Mistake 5: Ignoring Transferable Skills
**Problem:** Selling yourself as "complete beginner"  
**Solution:** Highlight how current skills apply (communication, project management, domain knowledge)
